# JWT Skill


## Scope gate

Use this skill only on assets you own, intentionally vulnerable labs/CTFs, or bug-bounty targets where the technique is explicitly permitted. Read program rules first. Use dedicated accounts and synthetic data. Prefer the least invasive proof that establishes the issue.

## Core foundations

**Class:** JSON Web Token Validation Flaws

**Classification:** Commonly maps to OWASP A07 Identification and Authentication Failures; CWE-347 and related signature/verification weaknesses

### Root cause

JWT security depends on strict algorithm selection, cryptographic verification, key selection, and semantic claim validation. A token can be cryptographically valid yet still unauthorized if issuer, audience, subject, lifetime, tenant, or token type are not correctly bound to the receiving service.

### High-signal attack surface

- Authorization: Bearer eyJ..., JWT cookies, JWS/JWE structures
- kid, alg, typ headers; iss, aud, sub, exp, nbf claims
- multiple services validating the same token differently

## Deep technical internals

For every candidate endpoint, answer these questions before sending aggressive tests:

1. Which component receives the attacker-controlled value first?
2. Which normalization/parsing steps transform it?
3. Which component makes the security decision?
4. Which component ultimately consumes the value?
5. Can those components disagree about identity, syntax, authority, state, or canonical form?

Treat the data-flow and trust-boundary diagram as part of the exploit, not documentation after the fact.

## Lab-level exploitation workflow

1. Decode without trusting; identify header, claims, issuer, audience, token type, and key source.
2. Test lifecycle semantics using tokens issued to your own accounts: expiry, logout, rotation, role changes.
3. Compare validation across services/endpoints for issuer/audience/type inconsistencies.
4. In a lab, test algorithm/key-selection edge cases and observe exactly which verifier decision fails.

### Mutation logic

- Claim substitution in a lab. Reason: distinguishes signed integrity from semantic authorization.
- kid/key-resolution changes in a lab. Reason: key lookup itself can become attacker-controlled input.
- aud/iss/token-type confusion. Reason: one valid token may be accepted by the wrong consumer.
- Clock-boundary tests. Reason: exp/nbf/leeway handling differs across libraries.

### Burp workflow

- Proxy one clean baseline flow and save it.
- Send the minimal candidate request to Repeater.
- Change exactly one security-relevant variable at a time.
- Use Comparer or structured response diffing when differences are subtle.
- Use Intruder only after you understand the variable and can keep request volume within scope.
- Preserve request/response pairs that prove both baseline and vulnerable behavior.

### Kali baseline

```bash
export TARGET='https://authorized-target.example'
# Passive/low-impact endpoint inventory from URLs you already possess:
printf '%s\n' "$TARGET" | httpx -silent -title -status-code -tech-detect
# Use curl for deterministic request reproduction:
curl -isk "$TARGET/known-path"
```

Do not interpret a scanner hit as a finding. Reproduce manually and explain the security invariant that failed.

## Real-world methodology

1. Start from application features, not vulnerability names.
2. Build an endpoint/parameter/state map from normal application use.
3. Label data origins: user input, headers, path variables, stored content, third-party callbacks, imported documents, tokens, client state.
4. Label security decisions: authentication, authorization, validation, canonicalization, routing, caching, transaction boundaries.
5. Prioritize places where one layer validates and another layer consumes.
6. Test alternate clients and forgotten surfaces: mobile APIs, old versions, exports/imports, background jobs, websocket/GraphQL endpoints, admin previews, and integrations—only when in scope.

## Advanced escalation

Potential authorized lab chains:

- JWT claim-validation flaw → horizontal/vertical auth confusion
- Stale token acceptance → revoked-session reuse
- Cross-service audience confusion → unintended API access in lab

Escalation rule: move to the next step only if it proves a distinct business/security impact. Do not expand blast radius merely to make the finding look more severe.

## Elite thinking

For each target, maintain a hypothesis table:

| Observation | Hypothesis | Minimal experiment | Expected secure behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feature accepts attacker-controlled state | A downstream component may trust a different representation | Change one representation while preserving semantics | Request is normalized and rejected/authorized consistently | Request + response + server-visible state |

Ask continuously:

- What assumption is the developer making here?
- Which layer enforces it?
- Is that enforcement applied to every alternate path?
- What representation reaches the security check versus the final consumer?
- What happens on retries, redirects, asynchronous jobs, or cross-service calls?
- What can two valid features do together that neither feature can do alone?

## hexstrike-ai role

Use OpenCode to build a JWT inspector that never labels a token secure merely because its signature verifies. hexstrike-ai can compare verifier behavior between endpoints and construct a claims-validation matrix.

Use AI for clustering, hypothesis generation, transformation analysis, response diffing, and code/test generation. Do not delegate scope decisions or vulnerability confirmation to the model.

## OpenCode tasks

Good tasks for OpenCode:

- Build a request corpus from sanitized Burp exports.
- Generate a one-variable-at-a-time mutation harness.
- Normalize JSON/HTML responses before diffing.
- Add rate limiting, retry limits, structured logs, and a dry-run mode.
- Generate unit tests that encode the expected secure invariant.
- Build a local vulnerable/fixed pair for the behavior under study.

## Full test environment

Create an issuer and two APIs with intentionally different validation policies. Include secure verification plus lab-only misconfigurations for algorithm selection, audience, issuer, key lookup, and token-type enforcement.

Recommended topology:

```text
Kali / Burp / hexstrike-ai / OpenCode
              |
        isolated lab network
              |
       vulnerable application
          /          \
 mock dependency   evidence logger
```

Keep the lab isolated from production networks and seed it only with synthetic secrets/accounts/data.

## Evidence checklist

- Exact affected endpoint and method
- Preconditions/account role
- Baseline request/response
- Modified request/response
- Server-side final state if relevant
- Why the behavior violates a security invariant
- Minimal impact demonstration
- False-positive controls
- Remediation at the correct trust boundary

## Stop conditions

Stop testing if you observe service instability, unexpected access to real user data, cross-user interference, irreversible state changes, or behavior forbidden by the program rules.
