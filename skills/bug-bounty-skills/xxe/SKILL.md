# XXE Skill


## Scope gate

Use this skill only on assets you own, intentionally vulnerable labs/CTFs, or bug-bounty targets where the technique is explicitly permitted. Read program rules first. Use dedicated accounts and synthetic data. Prefer the least invasive proof that establishes the issue.

## Core foundations

**Class:** XML External Entity Injection

**Classification:** CWE-611; historically OWASP A4:2017, with XML parser hardening now generally covered by secure configuration/injection controls

### Root cause

The failure occurs when an XML parser processes attacker-controlled DTD/entity constructs with external entity resolution or dangerous parser features enabled. Security depends on parser configuration, entity resolver behavior, network/file access, and downstream transformations such as XSLT.

### High-signal attack surface

- SOAP/XML APIs, SAML processors, SVG/XML uploads, Office/XML importers
- Content-Type application/xml, text/xml, SOAPAction, XML error messages
- server-side document conversion or parsing pipelines

## Deep technical internals

For every candidate endpoint, answer these questions before sending aggressive tests:

1. Which component receives the attacker-controlled value first?
2. Which normalization/parsing steps transform it?
3. Which component makes the security decision?
4. Which component ultimately consumes the value?
5. Can those components disagree about identity, syntax, authority, state, or canonical form?

Treat the data-flow and trust-boundary diagram as part of the exploit, not documentation after the fact.

## Lab-level exploitation workflow

1. Confirm the endpoint actually parses XML by introducing a harmless well-formedness error and observing parser behavior.
2. Use a benign internal entity to distinguish XML parsing from plain-text handling.
3. In a local lab, test whether external entities are resolved using a controlled file or callback resource.
4. Check each parsing path independently: request bodies, uploads, SVG, SOAP, and asynchronous import jobs may use different libraries.

### Mutation logic

- DOCTYPE placement and encoding. Reason: front-end filters may inspect text differently from the backend parser.
- Parameter entities in labs. Reason: parser feature sets may differ between general and parameter entity handling.
- XInclude/XSLT only where relevant. Reason: some stacks disable classic external entities but leave other XML inclusion mechanisms enabled.

### Burp workflow

- Proxy one clean baseline flow and save it.
- Send the minimal candidate request to Repeater.
- Change exactly one security-relevant variable at a time.
- Use Comparer or structured response diffing when differences are subtle.
- Use Intruder only after you understand the variable and can keep request volume within scope.
- Preserve request/response pairs that prove both baseline and vulnerable behavior.

### Kali baseline

```bash
export TARGET='https://authorized-target.example'
# Passive/low-impact endpoint inventory from URLs you already possess:
printf '%s\n' "$TARGET" | httpx -silent -title -status-code -tech-detect
# Use curl for deterministic request reproduction:
curl -isk "$TARGET/known-path"
```

Do not interpret a scanner hit as a finding. Reproduce manually and explain the security invariant that failed.

## Real-world methodology

1. Start from application features, not vulnerability names.
2. Build an endpoint/parameter/state map from normal application use.
3. Label data origins: user input, headers, path variables, stored content, third-party callbacks, imported documents, tokens, client state.
4. Label security decisions: authentication, authorization, validation, canonicalization, routing, caching, transaction boundaries.
5. Prioritize places where one layer validates and another layer consumes.
6. Test alternate clients and forgotten surfaces: mobile APIs, old versions, exports/imports, background jobs, websocket/GraphQL endpoints, admin previews, and integrations—only when in scope.

## Advanced escalation

Potential authorized lab chains:

- XXE → synthetic local file read in lab
- Blind XXE → controlled callback confirmation
- XXE → SSRF against a mock internal service

Escalation rule: move to the next step only if it proves a distinct business/security impact. Do not expand blast radius merely to make the finding look more severe.

## Elite thinking

For each target, maintain a hypothesis table:

| Observation | Hypothesis | Minimal experiment | Expected secure behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feature accepts attacker-controlled state | A downstream component may trust a different representation | Change one representation while preserving semantics | Request is normalized and rejected/authorized consistently | Request + response + server-visible state |

Ask continuously:

- What assumption is the developer making here?
- Which layer enforces it?
- Is that enforcement applied to every alternate path?
- What representation reaches the security check versus the final consumer?
- What happens on retries, redirects, asynchronous jobs, or cross-service calls?
- What can two valid features do together that neither feature can do alone?

## hexstrike-ai role

Have hexstrike-ai identify XML-capable endpoints from traffic and error fingerprints. Use OpenCode to create safe XML corpus files and a parser-behavior matrix for local testing.

Use AI for clustering, hypothesis generation, transformation analysis, response diffing, and code/test generation. Do not delegate scope decisions or vulnerability confirmation to the model.

## OpenCode tasks

Good tasks for OpenCode:

- Build a request corpus from sanitized Burp exports.
- Generate a one-variable-at-a-time mutation harness.
- Normalize JSON/HTML responses before diffing.
- Add rate limiting, retry limits, structured logs, and a dry-run mode.
- Generate unit tests that encode the expected secure invariant.
- Build a local vulnerable/fixed pair for the behavior under study.

## Full test environment

Create local endpoints using at least two XML parsers with secure and insecure configurations. Mount only synthetic files into the vulnerable container and include a local callback service for blind-resolution testing.

Recommended topology:

```text
Kali / Burp / hexstrike-ai / OpenCode
              |
        isolated lab network
              |
       vulnerable application
          /          \
 mock dependency   evidence logger
```

Keep the lab isolated from production networks and seed it only with synthetic secrets/accounts/data.

## Evidence checklist

- Exact affected endpoint and method
- Preconditions/account role
- Baseline request/response
- Modified request/response
- Server-side final state if relevant
- Why the behavior violates a security invariant
- Minimal impact demonstration
- False-positive controls
- Remediation at the correct trust boundary

## Stop conditions

Stop testing if you observe service instability, unexpected access to real user data, cross-user interference, irreversible state changes, or behavior forbidden by the program rules.
